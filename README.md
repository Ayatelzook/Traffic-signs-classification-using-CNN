# Traffic Sign Classification Using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify traffic signs. The model is trained on a dataset of traffic signs images and can predict the type of traffic sign in a given image.

## Overview

The code performs the following tasks:
1. **Data Preparation**: Loads and preprocesses traffic sign images.
2. **Model Training**: Trains a CNN on the processed images.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model on test data.
4. **Model Saving**: Saves the trained model for later use.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
